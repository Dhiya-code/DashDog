## 2. Tools

- **Prometheus**: Data collection and alerts.
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards.
- **Node Exporter**: System metric collection.
- **PromQL**: Queries for analyzing data.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline.

## 3. Workflow

1. Installed Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter.
2. Configured alerts like `HighCPUUsage`.
3. Simulated system load using the `stress` tool.
4. Debugged PromQL queries.
5. Verified CI/CD pipeline with automated builds and tests.
